# Network Automation & Security Provisioning Lab 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on automating network management and enhancing security within a Cisco-based infrastructure. By integrating **Python** and **Ansible**, the lab demonstrates an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** approach to handle daily operations and dynamic security policies efficiently without manual CLI intervention.

## 🖼 Network Topology

## ✨ Core Features
* **Dynamic Security Enforcement (Ansible):** Implemented **Time-Based ACLs** via Ansible playbooks (`block_time.yml`) to automatically restrict inter-network traffic based on scheduled business hours.
* **Automated Backups (Python):** Developed a **Python script** (`backup_network.py` using Netmiko) to perform daily configuration backups, saving running-config snapshots of each device to a centralized directory (`/backup_configs`).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Automation Tools:** 
  * **Ansible:** Security provisioning and ACL deployment.
  * **Python (Netmiko):** Automated device backups.
* **Infrastructure:** Cisco IOS.
* **Platform:** EVE-NG, Ubuntu Server.
